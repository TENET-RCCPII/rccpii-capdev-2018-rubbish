            <blockquote>
              <p>The Rural Campus Connectivity Project II is a follow-on project from RCCP I which ran from 2010 - 2014. The project is funded by the South African Department of Higher Education and Training, managed by Universities of South Africa (USAF), and implemented by the Tertiary Education and Research Network (TENET) of South Africa. Although RCCP I focused mostly on connecting the rural campuses to the network, RCCP II have a significant capacity development component to assist tertiary education facilities with adoption of internet for research and teaching and learning.This website will host information about capacity development opportunities that exist for staff and students at South African tertiary education facilities through the RCCP II project in 2018.</p>
